# Thermodynamics-project2
In this project two interesting application of Thermodynamics were solved using MATLAB and CANTERA. In the first application mass-flow rate of Argon for a Brayton cycle was analyzed. In the second problem an optimal pressure of flash chamber and thermal efficieny for a geothermal power plant was determined using various test case for pressures.
