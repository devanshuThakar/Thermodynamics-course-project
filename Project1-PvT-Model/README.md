# PvT-model
In this repositary a MATLAB script has been developed to genereate a 3D P-v-T model of a pure substance. The script uses CANTERA library to get the value of pressure for a given value of tempearture and volume. The obtained 3D-surface was converted into an stl file which can be 3D - printed. 

During the project two type of MATLAB scripts. One script was able to make the surface for the inside of dome only. The other script was able to generate the full 3D-surface. 

The surface plot inside the dome and the complete surface plot for CO2 is shown below.

The solid models generated from MATLAB are also shown as follows.

An application of C02 has been discussed in this project. For details see the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Jfh4p86uNpg" target="_blank">Video</a>
