# Thermodynamics-course-project
This repository contains the projects done in the course of undergraduate Thermodynamics course at IIT Gandhinagar. 

# Project-1
## PvT-model
In this repositary a MATLAB script has been developed to genereate a 3D P-v-T model of a pure substance. The script uses CANTERA library to get the value of pressure for a given value of tempearture and volume. The obtained 3D-surface was converted into an stl file which can be 3D - printed. 

During the project two type of MATLAB scripts. One script was able to make the surface for the inside of dome only. The other script was able to generate the full 3D-surface. 

The surface plot inside the dome and the complete surface plot for CO2 is shown below.

The solid models generated from MATLAB are also shown as follows.

An application of C02 has been discussed in this project. For details see the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Jfh4p86uNpg" target="_blank">Video</a>

# Project2
In this project two interesting application of Thermodynamics were solved using MATLAB and CANTERA. In the first application mass-flow rate of Argon for a Brayton cycle was analyzed. In the second problem an optimal pressure of flash chamber and thermal efficieny for a geothermal power plant was determined using various test case for pressures.
